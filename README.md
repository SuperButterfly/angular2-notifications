# Angular2-Notifications
A light and easy to use notifications library for Angular 2. It features both regular page notifications (toasts) and push notifications. 

## Example
Take a look at the live demo here: [Live Demo](http://flauc.github.io/angular2-notifications)
You can also clone this repository and check out the example folder.

## Documentation 

The implementation of push notifications and toasts is quit different so i decided to split the readme in to two files. 

Im currently working on push notifications, they are already available but its only a basic implementation. 
They should be fully functional in the next big release which will come in a few days.
